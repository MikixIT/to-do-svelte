# 📝 Svelte To-Do App

A simple To-Do app built with **Svelte**, made to learn and explore the basics of the framework: reactive variables, event handling, state management, and scoped styling.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete existing tasks
- Clean and minimal UI
- Super responsive (thanks to Svelte's reactivity)

## 🧠 What you'll learn

- Basic Svelte component structure (`<script>`, markup, `<style>`)
- Two-way data binding with `bind:value`
- Reactive updates with simple `let` variables
- Event handling with `on:click`, `on:keydown`, etc.
- Looping with `{#each}` and key tracking
- Scoped CSS styling
